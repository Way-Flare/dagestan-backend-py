    Mark a ViewSet method as a routable action.

    `@action`-decorated functions will be endowed with a `mapping` property,
    a `MethodMapper` that can be used to add additional method-based behaviors
    on the routed action.

    :param methods: A list of HTTP method names this action responds to.
                    Defaults to GET only.
    :param detail: Required. Determines whether this action applies to
                   instance/detail requests or collection/list requests.
    :param url_path: Define the URL segment for this action. Defaults to the
                     name of the method decorated.
    :param url_name: Define the internal (`reverse`) URL name for this action.
                     Defaults to the name of the method decorated with underscores
                     replaced with dashes.
    :param kwargs: Additional properties to set on the view.  This can be used
                   to override viewset-level *_classes settings, equivalent to
                   how the `@renderer_classes` etc. decorators work for function-
                   based API views.
